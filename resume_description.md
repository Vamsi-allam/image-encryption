# Image Encryption App - Resume Description

## Project Title
**Image Encryption Application** | Full-Stack Mobile Developer | [Optional: Duration, e.g., Jan 2023 - Present]

## Resume Description
Developed a secure image encryption application that provides end-to-end protection for sensitive visual data. Built using Flutter for cross-platform functionality, Firebase for backend services, and custom cryptographic algorithms for security. Features include password-based image encryption/decryption, secure cloud storage with user authentication, metadata management, and offline processing capability. Implemented AES-256 encryption standards with salt-based key derivation, secure key management, and binary data transformation techniques. Engineered responsive UI with adaptive layouts and smooth transitions while maintaining strict separation between encryption logic and presentation layers.

### Key Contributions & Technical Highlights:
* Architected and implemented a Flutter-based cross-platform application supporting Android, iOS, and web platforms
* Designed and integrated a custom image encryption/decryption algorithm that securely transforms images while preserving file integrity
* Implemented Firebase Authentication for secure user management and personalized encryption experiences
* Created a scalable cloud storage solution using Firebase Storage and Firestore for encrypted image management
* Built an intuitive UI with smooth transitions and responsive design patterns that adapts to various screen sizes
* Implemented offline capability allowing users to encrypt/decrypt images without an internet connection
* Utilized secure key management techniques to protect encryption keys and enhance application security
* [Optional: Include metrics, e.g., "Achieved 99.9% encryption reliability with processing speeds under 3 seconds for standard-sized images"]

### Technologies:
Flutter, Dart, Firebase (Authentication, Cloud Storage, Firestore, Hosting), Cryptography, State Management, UI/UX Design, Git, CI/CD
